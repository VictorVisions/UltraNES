# UltraNES
An Open Source NES pcb controller design for use on the Nintendo 64.
This is a work in progress passion project designed to be used on the Nintendo 64 while using the Everdrive-64 X7 nes core. 
The current design is based off of the N64 CFS8120-700010 PCB design.

# Schematic and Gerber files
The schematic, gerber files, and BOM are located under main/Code.

# Purchasing the PCB
Under the main branch download the file (UltraNES_v2_compressed.zip) and upload it to your preffered PCB manufacturing site such as... 
https://jlcpcb.com/, https://oshpark.com/ or similar PCB Manufacturers.

The reccomended PCB Specifications are:

1.6mm PCB Thickness, ENIG, with tented Via coverings

# Sourcing the components
All components can be ordered via Digikey minus the MX1720FC chip which will need to come from a donor board.
I have listed a current BOM of the components with part numbers to be used for ordering components through Digikey.

Please note that C1 has a duplicate footprint on the PCB if using SMD component versus a through hole capacitor.
